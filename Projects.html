                  <p class="card-text mb-auto">This project was done on Scratch.MIT.edu, and we worked on it from Aug. 30 to Sep 9, 2018. I worked with a partner, and we divided the work. It was divided pretty evenly, with both of us working on the code and the documentation to make it the best we could. The objective of the game was to help a wizard retrieve his spellbook, and you were playing as a knight. Our teamwork was pretty good and he had good communication. I learned how to work with Scratch and how to make a game. This was one of my first coding projects ever, so I needed to work extra hard and on my own time so I was able to understand the project. </p>

It allowed you to take multiple pictures and edit/drawn on them. My role was mainly to perfect the documentation, but I did help with the coding section of the project. I learned how to properly use App Inventor and what it was truly capable of. We worked together well and did a good job on completing the assignment.</p>

                  <p class="card-text mb-auto">This project was something me and my partner did for our CSP class, from Jan. 9 to Jan. 16, 2019. We needed to write a story that had different sections.\ It was user interactive, in which they could decide what paths to take and what actions to perform. I learned how to work better with python and how to use/manipulate the different functions we wrote. We worked really well together and got the job done.</p>
