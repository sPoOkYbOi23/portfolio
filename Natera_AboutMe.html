                        <p>Hello, my name is Brian Natera. I am 15 years old. I attend Dublin High School and I am in the ninth grade. When I grow up, I aspire to be a civil engineer. I really like the aspects of the career and would enjoy working as one for a living. In my opinion, the salary is decent, considering the annual salary for this career is $82,000. There are several colleges that offer a major about this, but my primary choice would be UC Berkeley. To be accepted into this college, you need a 3.85 unweighted GPA (or higher), a 4.39 weighted GPA (or higher), and a score of 2171 on the SAT or 33 on the ACT. As of now, my average G.P.A is higher than 3.5 and I have good grades in school. I have several hobbies, such as playing video games and sports. I do not really have a favorite video game, but my favorite sports are baseball and football. Thank you for taking the time to read about me, enjoy my website!</p>
